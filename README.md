This script simulates desire paths in a 2D domain using a biased A* algorithm, and pre-defined path and obstacle locations. 

Desire paths are created by erosion due to foot traffic and represent the path that an individual wishes to take, and often cut the corners of paved pathways (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path)

The outputs are compared to the satellite images of the desire paths acroos the Virginia Tech drill field (an example image in given in the outputs folder. 

HOW TO:

1. Download and unzip the files.
2. Ensure dP_Astar.py is available to the desirePaths.py script.
3. Run desirePaths.py.
4. Review the outputs.
